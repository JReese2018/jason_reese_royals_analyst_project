# Jason Reese's Kansas City Royals Project

Thank you for considering my application and giving me the opportunity to showcase what I can contribute to your organization. This Github Repo has all three sections of the project that was assigned: The Questionnaire, Querying Prompts, and Modeling Project. 


## Modeling Project
Files:
```http
Model Creation
  royals_modelling.ipynb

Streamlit Web App
  model_streamlit.py
```
This Streamlit Application gives interactivity to the user to put the Throwers or Errant Receiver in different situations and predict whether or not the play will result in the runner being out or safe.

The application is available through this link but can be ran locally in the folder by running the following code:
```bash
streamlit run model_streamlit.py
```
The requirements to run locally are streamlit, pandas and xgboost
```python
pip install streamlit pandas xgboost
```

The program has tabs for ranks and information about the models that give a better insight on how they function and the results they got from traning.

## Querying Prompts
File:
```http
  royals_querying_prompts.ipynb
```

This file showcases how I got to the answers that I got with the ability to easily change thresholds to get to more specific with answers someone might want.

Most of the answers are straight forward and dont need a lot of explanation.

## Questionnaire
